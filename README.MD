# DevTrial â€“ Interview Practice Simulator

DevTrial is a peer-to-peer web application designed to help software developers practice for technical interviews. It provides a real-time, collaborative environment where users can take turns acting as the interviewer and the candidate, solving coding problems together.

 <!-- Optional: Add a screenshot of your app -->

## How It Works

The application creates a seamless interview experience. A user logs in and is taken to their dashboard. From there, they can enter a matchmaking lobby to be paired with another user. Once a "candidate" and an "interviewer" are matched, they are placed into a shared, private interview room.

In the room, they have a synchronized code editor, a shared timer, and a video chat panel. The candidate codes the solution to a randomly selected problem while the interviewer observes and provides guidance, simulating a real-world technical screen.
